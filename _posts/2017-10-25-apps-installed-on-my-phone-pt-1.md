*Hi everyone*, in this post I try to show some apps installed on my phone and some reviews on them. Enjoy!

## 1. 5217 ##

{% include image.html src="/assets/images/5217.png" width="40%" alt="5217" %}

Developed by famous developer Francisco Franco, this app aims to help the user to be more productive by using the 52/17 work cycle based by [_the muse_][muse].

**My review:** As with another productivity timer like the famous [Pomodoro Technique][pomodoro], this app create a timer for work cycle, which is 52 minutes and 17 minutes break. Dominated by blue colour, the interface is so cool and intuitive. It got some options like notification LED, keep awake, quick settings toggle and auto DND mode during work cycles. There is Achievements for Google Play Games and stats sharing. The app comes for free, but with in-app purchase to support development of the app. For me, the app is worth donating because of the feature and because Francisco always develop high quality apps. For you who have no money to donate, I suggest to help translating the app (there is a button in the app to redirect you to the translation GitHub repo).

**Developer:** Francisco Franco

**Price:** Free, with IAP (IDR 29,000)

**Rating:** 9/10

## 2. Allo ##

Google attempt to challenge Whatsapp in chatting platform business, it comes with Google Assistant and Duo integration.

**My review:** Wonderful interface and full of features, this app is almost perfect for chatting with your friends. You can decorate chats with stickersand gifs. Google Assistant is the most amazing feature in this app. It can be summoned in your chat and can be asked for giving direction, sharing location, asking for weather, send poems daily or even for playing games! The Assistant surely is the most powerful feature I have seen in a chatting app. The app also have incognito mode for chat, which will delete the messages after specified time. There is no bloated feature like WhatsApp status or LINE timeline. The only problem I have is sometimes, Google Assistant is not send my daili subscription. But other than that, this app is mostly fine.

**Developer:** Google

**Price:** Free

**Rating:** 8/10

## 3. BBC iPlayer ##

{% include image.html src="/assets/images/bbc.png" width="40%" alt="BBC iPlayer" %}

Listen to live BBC radios streams and podcast through this full featured app from BBC.

**My review:** For you who still listen to radios and podcasts, particularly BBC's, this app is for you (you might have installed this app already heheh). Every single radios and podcasts from BBC are included in this app. You can listen, download and set alarm with radios from BBC. Sound quality is fine (although I don't know whether they stream with AAC format or MP3), and it have schedules for what's playing for every radio. The interface is fine, although not with Google Material Design, but it's still intuitive enough. The app itself is lightweight and easy on memory, so you can listen to your favourite BBC Radio while playing games or working with your phone.

**Developer:** BBC Worldwide

**Price:** Free

**Rating:** 8/10

## 4. Keep ##

{% include image.html src="/assets/images/keep.png" width="40%" alt="Google Keep" %}

Google note-taking app with autosync with Google account and some amazing features.

**My review:** This app is amazing. Like, literally. The interface is simple. The features are super cool and amazing. You can create notes, reminder, pinning notes, assign tags to notes and many more. This is one of my core productivity apps. And for Android users, you should definitely install this app. Probably gonna be your lifesaver. The downside: there is no IFTTT integration and official API, so no automation for you.

**Developer:** Google

**Price:** Free

**Rating:** 9/10

**Link:** [Keep][keep-play]

## 5. IFTTT ##

{% include image.html src="/assets/images/ifttt.png" width="40%" alt="IFTTT aka If This, Then That" %}

IFTTT (short for If This, Then That) is an automation app to automate tasks in internet services.

**My Review:** Super automation app. This is a __must-have__. You can automate everything as long as it's integrated with IFTTT. Want to automatically share your ~~liked~~ clapped Medium articles to LinkedIn? All you have to do is create an automation applet, and everytime you clap on some Medium article, the article is automagically shared to LinkedIn. It even has integration with Philips HUE lamp and many other IoT services. The interface is simple and to create a new applet is as easy as creating a Facebook account. You should check this out.

**Developer:** IFTTT

**Price:** Free

**Rating:** 9/10
