Adding an additional security layer of authentication is always a good idea, particularly in these times where password compromises and data breaches are common. A common additional layer of authentication is achieved through multi-factor authentication (MFA), where users are asked for another piece of information for authentication, such as on user login or when the user wants to access sensitive informations or perform a sensitive action. MFA is widely used nowadays, usually with time-based one time password (TOTP), which are generated by an app like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator or Authy. To enable MFA for desktop login in Fedora Linux using Gnome Display Manager, we can use the Google Authenticator PAM module.

## Installing & Setting-up the Google Authenticator PAM Module

First, we need to install the Google Authenticator PAM Module. In Fedora, we can install it with DNF:

```sh
sudo dnf install -y google-authenticator
```

For Silverblue, we can install it with rpm-ostree:

```sh
rpm-ostree install google-authenticator
```

Next, we need to configure `google-authenticator`. Run the following command:

```sh
google-authenticator
```
